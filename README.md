# Stock-Market-Prediction
Using Alpaca API I am trying to simulate how much money one could make using $20,000 in the stock market. <br>
I have chosen to use a LSTM(long short term memory model) to predict whether to purchase or sell the stock. <br>

I have 8 different stocks that I am going to be working with. 
<br> <br>
JPM: JP Morgan: financial service <br>
KULR: KULR Technology Group Inc: technology company <br>
META: Meta: technology company <br>
MS: Morgan Stanley: financial service <br> 
MU: Micron: technology company, produces computer memory and data storage <br>
NVDA: Nvidia: computer manufacturing company <br>
OKLO: OOKLA: digital media and internet company <br>
AVGO: Broadcom: technology company, creates semiconductors <br>

While predicting stock prices is a gamble since there are so many different factors influencing the price other than previous days, there is still a good oportunity to make money in the short term. This is done using a LSTM model, this model is designed to take into account sequential data and long term dependencies. Here is a great video explaining what an LSTM is (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCzL96nL7j0)
